            A word that for many still conjures images of deepfried noodles that you can buy in a styrofoam container for as little as .99&#162;. And while it is true that instant Ramen holds a spot under the classification of Ramen, and infact is a fairly interesting story in and of itself, it is far from the full story. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The exact origin of ramen and how and when it came to be is contested. What is widely accepted is that the dish originated in China, and that versions of it had made their way to Japan by the early 20th century, though it wouldn't be until the post war era that their popularity exploded, as at this time rice crops had production shortages but there was an abundance of American wheat.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ramen was intented to be fast food. You could buy it at stalls or in some dedicated restaurants but the time from which you ordered to the time in which it was in your hands could be measured in seconds. The broth, kept at a simmer in the kitchen, the only thing you had to wait on was the noodles to cook. It was intended to be food for people on the go, an analog to the humble American cheese burger, to this day many ramen restaurants in Japan have rules designed to limit how much time you spend in the shop. In addition to being fast, Ramen is also generally very cheap and as a result the only effective way to make a profit is through turning customers over.
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite ramen's status as fast food, despite images of instant noodles that are often conjured when speaking about what ramen is or isn't, today, there are world class michelin starred restaurants with chefs who operate with scientific precision to ensure each bowl is consistent one to the next. So please, click around and let me share my passion of ramen with you.</div>
